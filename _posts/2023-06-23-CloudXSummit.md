I have the pleasure and honor of being a speaker at the [CloudX Summit](https://www.stackit.de/en/cloudxsummit/) event, which will be held from June 26 to 28, 2023. I will have the pleasure of presenting a speech alongside the CEO of SCRM and the Chief Architect.

In the session titled "How to build and run one of Europe's biggest Loyalty Programs," we will see... just that :). As for my part, I will show how we do streaming data ingestion at scale.
