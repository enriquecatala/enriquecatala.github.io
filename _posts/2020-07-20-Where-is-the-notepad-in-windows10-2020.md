After updating my windows to the Version 2004 (19041.329), I found that **Notepad disapeared!** This seems some kind of a bug during the installation process...and the worst part is that despite the Notepad is still listed in the Windows Store

<mark>You canÂ´t install it from the Windows Store!</mark>

The solution is basically install Notepad from the "windows optional features"
