Suppose that you are working from a Windows Server 2019 and you require to make use to some linux scripts from there (and donÂ´t want to waste your time ssh-ing to other systems). The best way to that is to install any of the supported linux distributions, like for example "Ubuntu 20.04".

## Enable  WSL on WS2019

The first thing to do is to enable WSL on your windows machine 

```bash
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux
```
>IMPORTANT: This requires restart the system

```bash
curl.exe -L -o Ubuntu_2004.2020.424.0_x64.appx https://aka.ms/wsl-ubuntu-2004
Add-AppxPackage .\Ubuntu_2004.2020.424.0_x64.appx
```
